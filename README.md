# Rivv
A chrome extension for techies to save your web surfing if you are in public, especially office!!

Are you checking fifa matches in secret ? or watching youtube ? or what to buy for your loved one ?  or instagram ? or reading comics ? or anything that you are not supposed to cause you are in office and you fear that your manager or seniors might create a scene if they get a look ?

Tired of clicking those small close tab icons in hurry ? or closing the entire chrome window and have nothing to show if anyone comes around ?

Worry not, now you can do all of the above with #CONFIDENCE

Bringing you Rivv, a chrome extension which simply closes all unrelated tabs ( tabs that are not from stack overflow ) for you and also opens a new stackoverflow tab simultaneously 

So from now on surf whatever you have to in office with style and no sweat!
